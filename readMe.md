## How to Use

To run find index.html in template_html, then right click and open with live server.

This will show a gallery of things you can use in you project. Note that this isnt using an api for any data so you will have to figure that out.

The react and html page look the same so you dont have to run both. It is key to note that the react way doesnt use hooks and does have elements of context in it. you dont have to follow these if you don't want and pick certain parts out to add to your project.

All css is imported on a single page for this template.

## Important

The assets folder will need to be duplicated into your src for react unsure for the html and javascript route.
